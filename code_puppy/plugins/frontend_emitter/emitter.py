"""Event emitter for frontend integration.

Provides a global event queue that WebSocket handlers can subscribe to.
Events are JSON-serializable dicts with type, timestamp, data, and an
optional ``session_id`` channel for multi-tenant routing.

Session-channel model
---------------------
- Producers may attach a ``session_id`` to an event in two ways:
    1. Explicit kwarg:  ``emit_event(type, data, session_id="abc")``
    2. ContextVar:      set ``code_puppy.plugins.frontend_emitter.session_context.current_emitter_session_id``
                        before calling ``emit_event``; the value is
                        picked up automatically.
  The explicit kwarg always wins over the ContextVar.

- Consumers may subscribe in two ways:
    1. ``subscribe()``                        -> wildcard (all events)
    2. ``subscribe(session_id="abc")``        -> only events whose
                                                  ``session_id`` matches
                                                  ``"abc"``.
  Wildcard subscribers also receive session-tagged events. Session
  subscribers only receive events whose ``session_id`` exactly matches
  their filter (events with ``session_id is None`` are NOT delivered
  to session subscribers).

This design is fully backward compatible: existing 2-arg callers of
``emit_event`` and bare ``subscribe()`` calls behave identically to
before -- they just see ``session_id: None`` on emitted events.
