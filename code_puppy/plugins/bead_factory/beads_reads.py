"""Read-only ``bd`` queries for bead-chain (queue waterfall + introspection).

This module is one of two domain splits carved out of the original
monolithic ``beads.py`` (bead_chain-7xv): it owns every **read** path —
the ``bd ready`` / ``bd list`` queue waterfall and the per-bead
introspection helpers (``show``, ``memories``, blocker/pin checks). Its
sibling :mod:`beads_writes` owns mutations and epic/gate housekeeping,
and :mod:`beads` keeps the shared subprocess core (``_run_bd``,
``_parse_json_list``, the classification predicates, the constants) and
re-exports both halves so existing ``from .beads import ...`` call sites
and the flat ``import beads`` test suite keep working unchanged.

Monkeypatch contract (why we route through ``_beads``)
------------------------------------------------------
The test suite does flat ``import beads`` and stubs ``beads._run_bd`` /
``beads._parse_json_list`` / ``beads.show`` by attribute assignment on
the *facade* module. For those stubs to take effect, the functions here
must look those three names up on the live ``beads`` module object at
call time (``_beads._run_bd(...)``) rather than binding a local copy at
import time. Everything else (stable constants and pure predicates that
no test patches) is imported directly for clarity.
